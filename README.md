# S-101 Portrayal subWG
This focus group was set at S101PT5 (September 2020) to review and agree proposed changes to the S-101 Portrayal Catalogue and to record and manage ECDIS Performance requirements.
An Issue has been created for each discussion item. Please, in order to have an agile and productive meeting, take time to review and consolidate your organization's position in advance. Comments against each issue will be used to kick off the conversations.

**This subWG discussions originally were started and still are ongoing in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/S-101-Portrayal-subWG/Working-Documents/issues.**
